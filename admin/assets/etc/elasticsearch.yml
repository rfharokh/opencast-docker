## Elasticsearch Configuration

# Cluster name identifies your cluster for auto-discovery. If you're running
# multiple clusters on the same network, make sure you're using unique names.
cluster.name: opencast

# Home directory of the Elasticsearch installation:
path.home: ${karaf.home}/

# The location of the data files of each index / shard allocated on the node. Can hold multiple locations:
path.data: /data/index/data

# Path to log files:
path.logs: /data/log/

# Set the bind address specifically (IPv4 or IPv6):
#network.bind_host: 192.168.0.1

# Set the address other nodes will use to communicate with this node. If not
# set, it is automatically derived. It must point to an actual IP address.
#network.publish_host: 192.168.0.1

# Set both 'bind_host' and 'publish_host':
network.host: 127.0.0.1

# Set a custom port for the node to node communication (9300 by default):
#transport.tcp.port: 9300

# Set a custom port to listen for HTTP traffic:
#http.port: 9200

# Set a custom allowed content length:
#http.max_content_length: 100mb

# Disable HTTP completely:
#http.enabled: false
